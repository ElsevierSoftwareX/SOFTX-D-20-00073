# ORTiS Solver C++ Code Generation Tools
C++ code generation tools for CPU or FPGA simulation solvers of nonlinear electrical and power electronic systems

These tools are part of the Open Real-Time Simulation (ORTiS) framework.

Utilizing these tools and FPGA High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, real-time simulation solvers of sizable power electronic systems executing on FPGA devices with 35 nanosecond simulation time steps are feasible.

Solvers generated by the tools utilize the Latency Based Linear Multi-step Compound (LB-LMC) simulation method to solve system models.

The tools include the LB-LMC C++ Solver Code Generation C++ Library along with a Command Line Interface (CLI) executable to allow creation of simulation solvers via either C++ programming or command shell environments.

## Requirements

These tools require C++14 or higher complaint compiler suite to build, such as GCC.

Besides the C++ standard library, the tools depend on the following third-party libaries to compile:

  * Eigen 3 -- Linear Algebra Template Library
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

Solvers generated by the tools are C++03 complaint and do not have any dependencies.

High Level Synthesis (HLS) of C++ solvers for FPGA execution is supported using Xilinx Vivado HLx suite for Xilinx FPGA devices.
